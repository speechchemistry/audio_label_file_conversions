# How to convert from a Simple ELAN multi-tier EAF file to a SayMore EAF file. 

The tier types and tier names just need to be renamed as follows:

- Tier type "transcript" should be renamed as "Transcription"
- Tier type "translation" should be renamed as "Translation"
- Tier name "transcript" should be renamed to "Transcription"
- Tier name "trans-transcript" should be renamed as "Phrase Free Translation"

You can either do this in ELAN or change the XML manually with a text editor
